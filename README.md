# Real-time Object Detection and Measurement

## Overview
This project implements a real-time object detection and measurement system using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system detects objects in video streams or images and measures their dimensions in real-time.

## Features
Real-time object detection using state-of-the-art deep learning model YOLO.
Support for multiple video sources, including webcams and IP cameras.

## Requirements
Python 3.7+

OpenCV 4.5+

Yolo v8

NumPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```git clone https://github.com/darkxcodes/Real-OBD.git```
   
   ```cd Real-OBD```

2. Create a virtual environment :
   
   ```python -m venv venv```

3. Activate environment :
   
   ```source venv/bin/activate```
   
   On Windows, use
   
   ``` venv\Scripts\activate ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage 

Start the application:
   
   ```python main.py```


## Future Improvements

- More userfriendly.
- Implementation of attractive UI.
- And many more...
